I am a Master's student in physics at [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) in the group of [Jens Eisert](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-eisert/index.html), where I am working on deriving efficient bounds on the learning of special classes of quantum channels. Previously, I was an undergrad in Computing Mathematics, with minors in physics and computer science at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).
