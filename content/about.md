I am a senior year undergrad in Computing Mathematics, with minors in physics and computer science here at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). Broadly, I like to research the marriage between quantum information science and learning theory. At present, I am an exchange student at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo.
