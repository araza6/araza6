I am a Computing Mathematics major, and physics and computer science minor here at the City University of Hong Kong. Broadly, I like to research the union of physics, mathematics and computer science. Currently, I am a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student with [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) working to bring autodifferentiation capabilities to complex hamiltonians in QuTiP. For further information, see my resume [here](/Asad_RAZA_resume.pdf)
